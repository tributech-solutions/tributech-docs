# Install Customer Node

For the setup of the consumer node, the same steps as in [Install Owner Node](./install-owner-node.md) are required. It is possible to set the nodes up in two different Azure subscriptions if you want to create a more realistic testcase with a partner company.

Make sure to select a differing, unique node name.
