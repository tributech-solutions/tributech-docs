# Consume Data Overview
The Tributech DataSpace Kit offers data consumption on many levels, for which an overview is given here.

## Subscribe to a Dataset

Datasets are used to share data with other participants in the Dataspace. Follow the [**link**](subscribe_dataset.md) to find out how to subscribe to a shared Dataset.

## API

The DSK Node provides a set of REST APIs to access data as well as verify data authenticity and data integrity. Learn more about how to use them in our [**REST API guide**](./api.md).

## Audit

An Audit Tool is available on every DSK node which helps to manually verify data sets. Head over to the [**Audit section**](./audit.md) to learn how to use it.

## Grafana

[**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/grafana/) is an open source project which allows you to create dashboards and charts, directly from your data sets. How to set up a Grafana dashboard is explained [**here**](grafana.md).
