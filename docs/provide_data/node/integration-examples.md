# Integration Examples

The simplest way to integrate our APIs is through the [offered nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tributech.Dsk.Api.Clients).

For easy integration of the Data API and Trust API we also offer a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/tributech-solutions/tributech-dsk-api-clients) which contains our API clients and code-samples showcasing how the APIs can be used.

If you do not use C# you can generate your own API Client using any one of the publicly available OpenAPI code generators, such as <a href="https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator" target="_blank">the OpenAPI Generator</a>.
