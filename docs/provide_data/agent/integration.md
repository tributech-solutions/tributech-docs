# DSK Agent Edge Integration

## Integration

Integration of the DSK Agent Edge is simple since you can use your default exisiting connectors.
This is due to the fact, that the agent is integrated at the level of the message bus. <br />
MQTT is supported by standard, hence the Agent is compatible with all major message brokers & IoT Runtime solutions. It is e.g. tested and deployed in production with Mosquitto and RabbitMQ.<br />
Conclusively, you can use your exisiting connectors, all you have to do is adapt the configuration / routing.

Configuration Options for the DSK Agent Edge can be found [here](configuration.md).
