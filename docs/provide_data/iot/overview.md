# Overview IoT Integration
The DSK Edge Agent supports direct integration using the [**MQTT**](https://mqtt.org/) based message bus (see [**MQTT Source**](./mqtt.md))
or by using one of our additional DSK Edge Source services on the edge:

- [**OPC UA Source**](./opc-ua.md)
- [**Simulated Sensor/Source**](./simulated.md)

:::info
We do offer more options (RabbitMQ, Siemens IE,...) which will be documented soon. Please talk to your contact person at Tributech or send an email to our [Customer Advisory Team](mailto:customer-advisory@tributech.io) if you need more information.
