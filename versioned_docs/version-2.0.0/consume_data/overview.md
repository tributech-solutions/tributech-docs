# Consume Data Overview

Tributech offers data consumption on many levels, for which an overview is given here.

## Stream Explorer

Data visualization via the Tributech Node's web portal. The [**Stream Explorer**](streamexplorer.md) provides a detailed look of a stream's time series data including auto refresh.

## API

The Tributech Node provides a set of REST APIs to access data as well as verify data authenticity and data integrity. Learn more about how to use them in our [**REST API guide**](./api.md).

## Grafana

[**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/grafana/) is an open source project which allows you to create dashboards and charts, directly from your data sets. How to set up a Grafana dashboard is explained [**here**](grafana.md).

## Consume Shared Data

Datasets are used to share data with other participants. Follow the [**link to Shared Data**](shared_data.md) to find out how to subscribe to a shared Dataset and access the data once it was succesfully synced.
