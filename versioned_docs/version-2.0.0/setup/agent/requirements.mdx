# Requirements {#requirements}

The edge device must meet the following hardware and software requirements.

## Hardware Requirements {#hardware-requirements}

| Type | Minimum Requirement      | Recommend Requirement |
| :--- | :----------------------- | :-------------------- |
| CPU  | 1 Core (x86-64 / ARM32 ) | 2 Cores               |
| RAM  | 1 GB Ram                 | 2 GB Ram              |

The DSK Agent Edge itself does not actually consume that much RAM these are the requirements for the whole system. Keep in mind that these requirements strongly depend on the overall setup and the actual load of the agent. These are minimum requirements for rather small to medium amounts of data. If high volumes of data have to be processed the requirements are higher.

If you have any questions regarding infrastructure requirements, please talk to your contact person at Tributech or send an email to our [**Customer Advisory Team**](mailto:customer-advisory@tributech.io).

## Software Requirements {#software-requirements}

| Type    | Required                                                                                                         | Preferred                      |

| Runtime | Docker Engine (≥20) + Docker-Compose (≥1.26) | Docker Engine + Docker-Compose |

## Runtime

### Docker / Docker Compose {#docker-runtime}

The Tributech Agent Edge services can be run using [**Docker Engine**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) as a container runtime. We use [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for management/orchestration of the Docker services and provide according examples for [**Docker-Compose**](./setup/docker-compose/docker-compose-setup.mdx) and [**Azure**](./setup/azure/azure-setup.mdx) .

If you want to use any other container runtime (e.g. containerd) please talk to your contact person at Tributech or send an email to our [**Customer Advisory Team**](https://www.tributech.io/about-us/).

#### Docker Compose management commands  {#docker-compose-commands}

In the following we show some of the basic Docker Compose commands for the management of the Docker services of the Tributech Edge Agent.
Check the [**docker-compose CLI**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) and [**Docker CLI**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) documentation for a full overview of the commands.

Depending on your environment the commands might need to be run as root using `sudo`.

```bash
# pull docker images for all services
docker-compose pull

# create & start all services
docker-compose up -d

# check service status
docker-compose ps

# check logs of specific service (-f for following log output)
docker-compose logs -f -t --tail=500 dsk-agent

# stop all services
docker-compose stop
# stop single service
docker-compose stop dsk-agent
# restart single service
docker-compose restart dsk-agent
# start all services
docker-compose start
# start single service
docker-compose start dsk-agent

# remove services
docker-compose down
```
