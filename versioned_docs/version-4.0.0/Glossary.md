| [Tributech Agents](./tributech_agent/overview.md) | Agents also provide a secure bidirectional communication channel between the Tributech Node platform and Tributech Agent which enables not only the secure gathering of data points and proofs, but also the issuing of commands back to the connected environment |
| [Tributech Node](./tributech_node/overview.md) | The Tributech Node is the central layer of our Tributech Platform where every data will be collected. The customer use the Tributech Node UI to manage their agents and inspect collected data. |
| [Enrollment](./tributech_agent/agent_enrollment.mdx) | The Enrollment Process registers an [Tributech Agents](./tributech_agent/overview.md) to a [Tributech Node](./tributech_node/overview.md). Without a successful Enrollment Process a [Tributech Node](./tributech_node/overview.md) will not accept data or configuration of an [Tributech Agent](./tributech_agent/overview.md).|
| Enrollment certificate | The enrollment certificate is used during the [Enrollment](./tributech_agent/agent_enrollment.mdx) to authenticate [Tributech Agents](./tributech_agent/overview.md)  with the Tributech Platform. The same certificate can be used for multiple agents and be create by [Tributech Node](./tributech_node/agent_management.mdx). |
| Agent certificate | The agent certificate is an agent specific certificate which is also generated by the Tributech Node, but it is agent specific, and the user should never see this certificate since it is generated automatically and also handeled in an automated fashion by the Tribtuech Agent. |
