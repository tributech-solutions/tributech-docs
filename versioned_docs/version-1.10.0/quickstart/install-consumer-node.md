# Setup Consumer Node

For the setup of the consumer node, the same steps as in [**Setup Owner Node**](./install-owner-node.md) are required. It is possible to set the nodes up in two different Azure subscriptions if you want to create a more realistic testcase with a partner company.

:::caution
The node name and Email address must be unique within the whole DSK ecosystem! Please use an **individual node name** and **Email address for each new node**!
