Datasets are a collection of data streams, tags and descriptions which can be published in order to share the dataset and its content with other users of the Dataspace.

## Create a Dataset

To create a Dataset, connect to your node, click the "+" symbol and select "New Dataset".

Add however many data sources and streams/events are needed for the use case. The IDs are required to publish data so write them down or come back to the Dataset whenever they are needed.

## Publish a Dataset

Publishing a Dataset makes a certain timeframe of the data available for selected data consumers in the Dataspace.  
In order to publish the Dataset, head once again to "My Datasets", select the Dataset and hit the "Add Publication" button.
